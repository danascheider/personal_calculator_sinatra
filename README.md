# Personal Calculator Sinatra

This project, along with the [Rails 5](https://github.com/danascheider/personal_calculator) and [Rails 4](https://github.com/danascheider/personal_calculator_rails_4) implementations, is a simple REST API intended to be used for the purpose of developing the contract testing tool [Rambo](https://github.com/danascheider/rambo).

This is the simplest possible Sinatra app. I will write some variants and put them in other repos.
